A React frontend and Express Node server to upload and burn timestamps into movies.

## Running locally

In the top-level directory, install all the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Build the React application for deployment:

```
npm run build
```

Start the node server:

```
node server.js
```

This starts the server listening on port 8080. Go to `localhost:8080` to see the page.
